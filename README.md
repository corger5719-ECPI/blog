# My Blog Website

This is a simple blog website I created as part of a web development exercise. The goal of this project was to practice using semantic HTML, linking and organizing CSS files, building a responsive layout, and adding basic animations with CSS.

## Features
- Semantic HTML5 structure (header, nav, main, articles, section, footer)
- A responsive layout using Flexbox
- A contact form with required fields
- CSS media queries for phone, tablet, and desktop screens
- A colorful sunset gradient theme
- Fade-in animation and hover effects

## Files in This Project
| File Name | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `blog.html` | The main webpage containing the blog and contact form |
| `styles.css` | The stylesheet used to style the blog layout, colors, and animations |
| `README.md` | Overview and explanation of the project |

## How to View the Website
1. Download or clone this project.
2. Open the `blog.html` file in any web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.).
3. The page will automatically load the styles from `styles.css`.

## Contact Form Details
The form includes:
- Name (required)
- Email (required)
- Subject (optional)
- Message (required)

The form is not yet connected to a real backend, so it does not send messages yet. It only shows the form fields for practice purposes.

## Responsive Design
The layout changes depending on screen size:
- **Phones:** Blog articles stack in one column.
- **Tablets:** Blog articles take full width.
- **Desktops:** Blog articles display side-by-side.

This is controlled using CSS media queries.

## Future Improvements (Optional Ideas)
- Connect the contact form to a backend (PHP, Node.js, or FormSubmit)
- Add real blog posts
- Add a navigation bar that stays at the top when scrolling (sticky nav)
- Add images or icons to blog posts
